#Allows the user to input holiday information.
#Calculates the total cost of the holiday.

#Greet the user.
#Prompt the user to input the destination city, number of hotel nights, and car rental days.
#Call the "holiday_cost" function with the inputs.
#Assign the result to "total_holiday_cost".
#If the city input is invalid, print "Invalid input".
#Otherwise, print a summary of the holiday details and the total cost in pounds.
